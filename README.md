# Ravenswood Peer School

This project describes a method by which an school can identify other school that are most similar to itself using a methodology that identifies the nearest institutional neighbors based on a weighted set of factors accessed from CAASP (California State Testing) data. An alternative to linear regression, the Nearest Neighbor methodology is robust and flexible; it is easy to understand and to explain to others; and it is a healthy hybrid that integrates the complex qualitative and quantitative characteristics present in a school. Use and outcomes of the method is discussed.



### Research Questions 

- How should peer school status be determined?
- How do Ravenswood Schools compare to peer schools on statewide ELA and Math assessments?
- How do Ravenswood Schools compare to peer schools on the Summative ELPAC assessment?
- Who are our peer schools?
